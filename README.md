# Pix2Pix-GAN
I implemented the Pix2Pix GAN Paper. The primary aim of this GAN is to generate map images from a given satellite image. I used some really cool techniques to make the training faster. Although the paper suggests to run the model for 200 Epochs, I have only tried it for 25 Epochs. But the results were really good.
